# Bankruptcy Prediction using Neural Nets
This repo contains a project which I have done as a part of my course work in deeplearning and neuralnets. I have done a project to predict bankruptcy of companies.
In this project we have used a dataset which contains 64 different financial variables of the companies in the years 2007-2012 with labels of bankruptcy in year 2012.
Through this project we intended to find how advance can we predict bankruptcy and prevent it with considering only this years performance.
We have developed a neuralnet model with dropout to predict the bankruptcy for each year dataset. We used classical machine learning algos and compared their performance with the neuralnet model.
In general for these kind of classification SVM performs better but for this dataset since we used dropout technique to regularise the cost function neuralnet performed better than SVM for this dataset.
